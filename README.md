A program I'm working on to visualize historical weather data. Eventually I hope it will be able to take any kind of spreadsheet data and make any kind of chart from data within that spreadsheet.




# WeatherMapper
This is the main program that I'm currently working on. Visually, it looks terrible, currently, but I want to get it functioning correctly before I worry about prettying up the UI.

Example:

# TornadoAnimation
This program is only tangentially related to the main program. I made this first as part of my journey to more easily visualize datasets. It shows an animation of all of the tornadoes from 1950-2022.
